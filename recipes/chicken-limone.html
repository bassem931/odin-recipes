                <h2>How to Make chicken limone</h2>

                <h3>Description</h3>

                <p>Chicken limone is a luscious way to prepare chicken cutlets. The lemon pan sauce, with shallots for a
                    sweet
                    onion
                    note, and just a touch of cream, really boosts the flavors of the browned bits that remain in the
                    pan.
                    It’s
                    well-balanced, with great lemon flavor but no sour notes. Like chicken piccata without the salty
                    capers,
                    it’s a
                    great quick dish for a weeknight dinner with friends. </p>

        <h3>How to Make chicken limone Step-By-Step</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>

            <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place flour in a shallow bowl. Dredge chicken cutlets in flour,
                shaking
                off excess. Place chicken on a large plate. </li>

            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to skillet, and cook until golden and
                cooked
                through, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a large plate. </li>

            <li>Add butter, shallot, and lemon zest to drippings in skillet, and cook over medium heat, stirring
                constantly,
                until shallot is softened, about 1 minute. Add lemon juice, and cook, scraping up any browned bits from
                bottom of skillet. Stir in chicken broth and parsley; cook, stirring often, until slightly thickened,
                about
                2 minutes. </li>

            <li>Remove from heat, and slowly add cream, whisking constantly and vigorously. Return chicken to skillet,
                and
                spoon sauce over chicken. Garnish with quartered lemon slices before serving. </li>
        </ol>
